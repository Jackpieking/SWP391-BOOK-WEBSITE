        <p>When Gintoki apprehends a movie pirate at a premiere, he checks the camera's footage and finds himself
            transported to a
            bleak, post-apocalyptic version of Edo, where a mysterious epidemic called the "White Plague" has ravished
            the world's
            population. It turns out that the movie pirate wasn't a pirate after all—it was an android time machine, and
            Gintoki has
            been hurtled five years into the future! Shinpachi and Kagura, his Yorozuya cohorts, have had a falling out
            and are now
            battle-hardened solo vigilantes and he himself has been missing for years, disappearing without a trace
            after scribbling
            a strange message in his journal.<br><br>Setting out in the disguise given to him by the android time
            machine, Gintoki
            haphazardly reunites the Yorozuya team to investigate the White Plague, and soon discovers that the key to
            saving the
            future lies in the darkness of his own past. Determined to confront a powerful foe, he makes an important
            discovery—with
            a ragtag band of friends and allies at his side, he doesn't have to fight alone.</p>
